This plugins allows you to rename physically the media files by updating their titles. It also updates theirs links in the posts automatically.

== Description ==

The Media File Renamer is a WordPress plugin that renames media files nicely for a cleaner system and for a better SEO.

By default, it does it automatically depending on the title of your media. When files are renamed, the references to it are also updated (posts, pages, custom types and their metadata). There is also a little dashboard called File Renamer in Media that will help you rename all your files at once.

The Pro users are given a few more features like manual renaming and advanced logs (SQL queries). An excellent way to use the plugin is to actually let it do the renaming automatically and do it manually for a few files for fine tuning.

BE CAREFUL: File renaming is a dangerous process. Before renaming everything automatically, try to rename a few files first and check if all the references to this file are still alright on your website. Depending on your plugins, theme or specific settings, the plugin might not find all the references. I strongly advise you to backup your database and your uploaded files first. If references aren't updated properly, please contact me with details about it. I will try my best to cover more and more special cases.

This plugin works perfectly with WP Retina 2x (and therefore, the retina files), WPML and many more. Is has been tested in Windows, Linux, BSD and OSX systems.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Check the FAQ on the official website, here: http://apps.meow.fr/media-file-renamer/faq/.

If you are a developer and willing to customize the way the file are renamed, please use the mfrh_new_filename filter. The $new is the new filename proposed by the plugin, $old is the previous one and $post contains the information about the current attachment.

`
add_filter( 'mfrh_new_filename', array( $this, 'filter_filename' ), 10, 3 );

function filter_filename( $new, $old, $post ) {
  return "renamed-" . $new;
}
`

== Screenshots ==

1. Type in the name of your media, that is all.
2. Special screen for bulk actions.
3. Has to be renamed.
